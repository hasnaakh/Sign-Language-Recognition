In Anaconda:
1. Make environment in Anaconda and choose python==3.8.19.
2. Install libraries and packages that is in requirements.txt file.
3. Install jupyter notbook.


In jupyter notebook start run:-

To train the model:
1. Import and Install Dependencies "in one line to be incompatible with each other" .
2. Keypoints using MP Holistic "Press q while raising your left hand when the webcam opens to capture keypoints".
3. Extract Keypoint Values.
4. Setup Folders for Collection.
5. Collect Keypoint Values for Training and Testing.
6. Preprocess Data and Create Labels and Features.
7. Build and Train LSTM Neural Network "in input shape when create model put the numbers of y & z of X.shape".
8. Make Predictions.
9. Save Weights "this is your trained model 'action.h5' ".
10. Evaluation using Confusion Matrix and Accuracy.
11. Test in Real Time "set a number of colors appropriate to the number of words you have in the model " .

To test the model:
1. Install the model in your device 'action.h5' .
2. Import and Install Dependencies "in one line to be incompatible with each other" .
3. Keypoints using MP Holistic "Press q while raising your left hand when the webcam opens to capture keypoints".
4. Extract Keypoint Values.
5. Run the commented code that it is at the beginning of the 'Test in Real Time' .
6. Test in Real Time "set a number of colors appropriate to the number of words you have in the model " .
